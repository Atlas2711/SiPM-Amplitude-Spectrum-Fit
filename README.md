# SiPM-Amplitude-Spectrum-Fit
---
## Disclaimer
I do not guarantee, that the Code will work for all SiPM Amplitude Spectra! As of now it is very simpel and could probably be improved a lot. Bear in mind, that it was used for a very specific task and thus, using it for your purposes probably will require some changes to the Code.

## How to use
The Program only excepts 5 inputs in the Preamble: The SiPM name, the first Bin to use for the Fit (must be before 0 pe Peak), The number of Peaks with good resolution and values for y-min and y-max for the output plots it will generate.
